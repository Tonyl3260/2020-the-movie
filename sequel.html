    <h2>Robots Are Taking Over The World!</h2>
    <p>It is the year 2050, another tragedy is about to take place because technology has gone too far. Humans created robots to make things easier for them, however robots are fed up and no longer want to work under
      the heartless humans. They wanted their freedom. Robots with their super intelligent manage to hack into the system that once control them. They are now
      set free and want to eradicate humanity.</p>
